Golden Model matrix generator

First, open matrix_gen.py
This code generates the input matrices and the respective dimensions - the txt files dimensions,matrixa and matrixb.
1. Make sure the location of all the matrices are right.
2. Adjust DATA_WIDTH parameter accordingly.
3. Choose the MAX_DIM of your choice.

Then open Golden_Model.py
This code takes matrixa and matrixb and calculates the respective matrixc
1. Make sure the location of all the matrices are right.
2. Run the code.

** matrix1, matrix2 and result_matrix aren't the actual matrices for the design, it's only for visibility and for the python code.
The actual matrices for the design are in matrixa, matrixb and matrixc.

That's it
