# Matrix Multiplication Using Systolic Arrays - Verification Part


## Overview
This repository contains the Verilog code for a matrix multiplication design along with its testbench and tester module. The purpose of this README is to provide an overview of the verification process conducted for this design.

## Verification Methodology
The matrix multiplication design has been thoroughly verified using a combination of simulation-based testing, functional checking, and functional coverage analysis. The verification process includes the following steps:

1. **Simulation-Based Testing**: The Verilog testbench utilizes SystemVerilog constructs to simulate the behavior of the matrix multiplication design under various conditions. This includes testing different input matrices, configurations, and control signals to ensure correct functionality.

2. **Functional Checker**: A functional checker module (`matmul_checker`) is employed to monitor the behavior of the design during simulation. The checker module verifies specific functional properties or requirements of the design by examining its internal signals, state transitions, or output behavior. This helps ensure that the design adheres to the specified functional requirements.

3. **Functional Coverage Analysis**: Functional coverage analysis is performed to assess the completeness of the verification process. Coverage metrics are defined to track which aspects of the design functionality have been exercised during simulation. This includes coverage of input space, state space, control signals, and specific design features. The coverage results help identify areas of the design that require additional testing or refinement to achieve comprehensive verification.

4. **Golden Model Comparison**: A golden model of the matrix multiplication algorithm is implemented in Python. This golden model serves as the reference for verifying the correctness of the Verilog design. The design's output matrices are compared against the corresponding matrices generated by the golden model to ensure consistency.

5. **Randomized Testing**: To thoroughly validate the design, 500,000 random value matrices of random sizes are generated using the Python-based golden model. These random matrices are used as inputs to both the Verilog design and the golden model. The outputs produced by the Verilog design are compared against the outputs generated by the golden model for correctness.

## Running the Verification
To run the verification process:

1. **Simulation**: Use a SystemVerilog simulator to compile and execute the testbench (`matmul_tb.sv`) along with the design (`matmul_stimulus.sv`). Ensure that the testbench environment is properly configured to interface with the design.

2. **Functional Checker**: Incorporate the functional checker module (`matmul_checker.sv`) into the simulation environment to monitor the design's behavior and verify its functional properties.

3. **Functional Coverage**: Integrate the functional coverage module (`matmul_coverage.sv`) into the simulation environment to collect coverage data during simulation. Analyze the coverage results to ensure comprehensive verification of the design.

4. **Golden Model Comparison**: Execute the tester module (`matmul_tester.sv`) to compare the output matrices generated by the Verilog design against the matrices produced by the Python-based golden model. Ensure that the appropriate paths to the input matrices are provided in the testbench environment.

5. **Randomized Testing**: The random value matrices generated by the Python-based golden model are included in the repository. These matrices can be used as inputs to the testbench for randomized testing. Ensure that the testbench environment is set up to read these matrices and that the results are compared against the golden model outputs.

## Interface Information
The `matmul_interface.sv` file contains the definition of the matrix multiplication interface. The interface includes signals for clock, reset, control, and data communication between the design and testbench.

## Conclusion
The verification process ensures that the matrix multiplication design functions correctly under various conditions and input scenarios. By employing simulation-based testing, functional checking, and functional coverage analysis, we can confidently validate the correctness, accuracy, and completeness of the design implementation.
